Ruby wrapper for Tidepool API over HTTP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/unitio-org/tidepool.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/unitio-org/tidepool)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tidepool'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tidepool

## Usage
```ruby
  response = Tidepool::Client.login(username: your_username, password: your_password)
  user_id = response["user_id"]
  session_token = response.headers["x-tidepool-session-token"]

  client = Tidepool::Client.new(session_token: session_token)

  users = client.users(user_id: user_id)
  users.inspect

  data = client.data(user_id: users.first["userid"])
  data.inspect

  notes = client.notes(user_id: users.first["userid"])
  notes.inspect
```
Options can be passed to the data and notes notes method

You can pass query options as follows
```ruby
client.data(user_id: "1234", options: { query: { type: "basal" } } )
```

All available parameters can be found here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
